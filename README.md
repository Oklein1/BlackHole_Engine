# BlackHole Engine 🚀🌌

Welcome to the BlackHole Engine! In this interactive web simulation, you take control of a state-of-the-art spaceship navigating through the vastness of space, all while encountering the mysterious forces of a gravitational black hole.

## How It Works

### Spaceship Control 🛸
Use the arrow keys to effortlessly navigate your spaceship across the screen. Feel the thrill of controlling your craft with smooth and responsive movements.

### Gravitational Pull 🌀
Encounter the gravitational force of a black hole, simulated through a series of concentric rings (circles) surrounding it. The intensity of the pull increases as you approach each ring. The closer you get to the black hole, the stronger the force it exerts on your spaceship.

### Gravitational Logic 🌐
The gravitational pull is dynamically calculated based on your spaceship's distance from the black hole. As you venture through different rings, each corresponding to a specific distance interval, the pull varies in strength. The logic behind the simulation involves assessing the current distance, determining the appropriate gravitational field, and adjusting the spaceship's position accordingly.


## Getting Started on your local system:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/BlackHole_Engine.git
   ```

2. **Open <code>index.html</code> in your local browser:**
```bash
  cd space-explorer-simulator
  open index.html
```
3. **Use arrow keys to control the spaceship:**

- Up: Move forward
- Down: Move backward
- Left: Move left
- Right: Move right
  
4. **Feel the gravitational pull:**
